YatZy rule:

Scoring[edit]
The following combinations earn points:

Upper Section:

Ones: The sum of all dice showing the number 1.
Twos: The sum of all dice showing the number 2.
Threes: The sum of all dice showing the number 3.
Fours: The sum of all dice showing the number 4.
Fives: The sum of all dice showing the number 5.
Sixes: The sum of all dice showing the number 6.
If a player manages to score at least 63 points (an average of three of each number) in the upper section, they are awarded a bonus of 50 points.

Lower Section:

One Pair: Two dice showing the same number. Score: Sum of those two dice.
Two Pairs: Two different pairs of dice. Score: Sum of dice in those two pairs.
Three of a Kind: Three dice showing the same number. Score: Sum of those three dice.
Four of a Kind: Four dice with the same number. Score: Sum of those four dice.
Small Straight: The combination 1-2-3-4-5. Score: 15 points (sum of all the dice).
Large Straight: The combination 2-3-4-5-6. Score: 20 points (sum of all the dice).
Full House: Any set of three combined with a different pair. Score: Sum of all the dice.
Chance: Any combination of dice. Score: Sum of all the dice.
Yatzy: All five dice with the same number. Score: 50 points.
Two Pairs and Full House must have different numbers so that the combination 15566 will score 22 as Two Pairs, but 15555 will score nothing in that category.

Some combinations offer the player a choice as to which category to score them under. A full house could be scored in the Full House, the Three-Of-A-Kind, 
Two Pairs, One Pair or the Chance categories. So 22555 would score 19 in Full House or Chance, 15 in Three-Of-A-Kind, 14 in Two Pairs or 10 in One Pair.
